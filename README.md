# DataScience
My projects from the field of data science (Python, SQL)

## 1. LOAN DATA - classification
This is my project from the Future Collars Science Data Course wrote in Python. It involves the classification of potential borrowers in terms of loan payment 
or loan default. It was created based on the data provided by LaneClub. The project consists of 4 sections and includes: Data Processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, 
Feature Engineering and Modeling. In modeling section, I tested various machine learning algorithms in order to choose the optimal final model and tune 
its parameters. The final model was Random Forest with Stratefied k-fold Crossvalidation and optimized parameters.

## 2. Cloth Shop (Sklep Odzie≈ºowy) - MySQL database project
This is my project from the Future Collars Science Data Course wrote in MySQL. I used Xampp Xampp environment.
